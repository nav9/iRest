This program is still under construction.

# iRest
A program that reminds you to rest your eyes. This program is being created after more than a decade of my experience with chronic eye strain and my eventual recovery.

# IDE
VS Code. You'll notice some extra files like launch.json that are specific to VS Code. These files and the IDE are not essential to running the program. You can simply run the program from the commandline using `python3 main.py`.
