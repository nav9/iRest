# About iRest  
A program that reminds you to rest your eyes. This program is being created after more than a decade of my experience with chronic eye strain and my eventual recovery. The "i" at the beginning of "iRest" has nothing to do with the Apple company. The "i" refers to you.

# IDE used  
VS Code. You'll notice some extra files like launch.json that are located in the ".vscode" folder. Such files are specific to VS Code. These files and the IDE are not essential to running the program. You can simply run the program from the commandline using `python3 main.py`.

# Supporting programs required  
You need to install the following programs to use iRest:  
  
## On Linux (Ubuntu)  
* Gnome screensaver (to detect when the screen is locked): `sudo apt install -y gnome-screensaver`
* Speed Say speech engine (for spoken audio notifications): spd-say
