# iRestTracker
A handy program that runs in the background, keeping track of how long you used the computer, and reminds you when to take rest.   
  
# The State Transition Diagrams
The StateTransition.odg file can be opened with Libre Office Draw. The contents of the file are what are shown in StateTransitions.png. These states describe the transition possibilities that are programmed in the state classes. It follows a principle similar to the State Design Pattern.  

# Diagrams
StateTransitions.odg is a LibreOffice document that depicts the states that the program transitions between. The StateTransitions.png file is just the exported image of the odg file.  

# TODO
* Add an AI with ANN and time-series-analysis to learn the User's comfort level (amount of time they use the computer continuously without any problems) and present the strain reminder accordingly.
* Display a visual dialog box or a system tray notification.
* Program the lock screen detection for Windows and Mac.
* Have a config file for variables like log activation.
